# Sprint Length #

Does sprint length matter?  Is 2 weeks the default?  What about one week?  One month?  Why would you choose one over the other?  Why do sprints at all?

Regarding sprints, the Scrum guide says "They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency." Later it says "When a Sprintâ€™s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame."

One advantage that Agile practices have over more traditional methods is the built in acknowledgement that things change.  Plans change.  Understanding changes.  Markets change. Customers and competitors change.  Sprints create regular opportunities to reflect on what you've learned, and to adapt your plan based on what you have learned.  When choosing a sprint length for your team, consider the tradeoffs between longer and shorter sprints and choose the one that best meets your needs.
