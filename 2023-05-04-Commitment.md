# Commitment #

Scrum empowers the development team to own their commitments.  What does this mean?  No one can tell the team how much work to do in a sprint.  The product owner and stakeholders own the prioritization of the work, but only the dev team owns their commitment.  This ownership comes with responsibility, though.  The dev team is responsible for consistently delivering on the commitments they make.  In doing so, they create expectations about how much value they can deliver in a sprint which can be used to forecast future value delivery.

Inconsistently delivering on commitments has a few negative impacts.  It can erode trust between the business and the dev team.  It impairs the already imperfect ability to forecast future work.  If rollover work exists from the previous sprint, then it means you only have a fraction of your velocity to devote to new work.  For example, if a team is regularly delivering 25 story points of value, but rolling over 10, it means that on the following sprint they really only have the capacity to add 15 points of new work without dropping any of the rollover work.  Furthermore, if they work the stories in order, then it is likely that many of those new story points will be the rollover for the next sprint.  If a team is doing 2 week sprints, this means many stories won't be delivered for 4 weeks because they get caught in the rollover cycle.

A big challenge we face is high priority customer support issues that get added into a running sprint because they can't wait for the next sprint.  No one can predict the future, or know how much of this work is likely to show up.  Teams try to leave room for a certain amount of this unplanned work, but it's impossible to know how much room to leave.  My recommendation would be to leave more room than you think you need.  It'd be better to add more work into a sprint because you didn't have unplanned work than to fail to deliver on your commitments.  Another option is to swap out a planned story to make room for unplanned work.  It's better to manage expectations and renegotiate your sprint commitment rather than show up to sprint review with undelivered stories.

Committing to more points doesn't mean you'll get more work done.  A team will only do as much work as they can do, regardless of what they commit to.  Predicting the future is impossible, but if you are doing well at it, you will undercommit about as often as you overcommit.  If you haven't undercommitted in a while, try it.  Undercommit deliberately.  Enjoy a sprint with 100% delivery.  Recalibrate your future commitments based on what you learn from it.
